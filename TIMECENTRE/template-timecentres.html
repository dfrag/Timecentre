				<h2>What is a Timecentre?</h2>
				<p>A Timecentre is a network of people changing their lives by using their time as a currency. We want you to get involved today!</p>
				
				<p>Each volunteer earns 1 time credit for 1 hour of their time being an active citizen, helping others an organisation by using their skills. A traditional timebank would allow those members to 'spend' their timecredits on another persons services or skills, essentially 'swapping' their time credits in exchange for goods and services.</p>
				
				<p>Timecentres UK has a growing network of regional and national companies that are accepting time credits for  goods and services.  Join the movement, sign up now! </p>
				
				<p>For more information about our flagship Timecentre region, to arrange a callback or to visit us, please <a href="mailto:timeteam@timecentres.co.uk?Subject=Hello" target="_top">email</a></p>
