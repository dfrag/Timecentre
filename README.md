design for Timecentre

A Timecentre is a network of people changing their lives by using their time as a currency.
We want you to get involved today!

Each volunteer earns 1 time credit for 1 hour of their time being an active citizen, helping others an organisation by using their skills. A traditional timebank would allow those members to 'spend' their timecredits on another persons services or skills, essentially 'swapping' their time credits in exchange for goods and services.

Timecentres UK has a growing network of regional and national companies that are accepting time credits for goods and services. Join the movement, sign up now!
